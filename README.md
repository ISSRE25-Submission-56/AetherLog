# SmartRCA

SmartRCA is an interpretable root cause analysis framework that integrates structured knowledge from a knowledge graph (KG) with inference capabilities from large language models (LLMs). It enhances the accuracy of root cause analysis in large-scale systems.

## Features
- Entity extraction using LLMs
- Embedding-based clustering for entity normalization
- Deduplication of knowledge graph construction
- Context-aware entity recall and root cause inference

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Run the Project
To run the project, simply use:
```bash
python main.py
